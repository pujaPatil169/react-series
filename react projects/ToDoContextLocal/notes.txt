When you store data in localStorage, it is always saved as a string. Therefore, even if you're saving a JSON object, it's actually converted to a string format using JSON.stringify(). To retrieve this data and use it as a JavaScript object, you must first parse the string back into JSON format using JSON.parse().

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Save data in localStorage: You would typically stringify your object before saving it.

javascript
Copy code
let todos = [{ task: 'Do homework', done: false }];
localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(todos));
Retrieve and parse the data: When you retrieve the data, it is in string format. To convert it back to a JavaScript object, you use JSON.parse():

javascript
Copy code
let storedTodos = localStorage.getItem('todos');
let todosObj = JSON.parse(storedTodos);  // Converts the string back to an object
console.log(todosObj);  // Now you can use the data as a JavaScript object
If the data stored in localStorage is valid JSON (which it should be if you used JSON.stringify()), JSON.parse() will successfully convert it back into the original object or array.
