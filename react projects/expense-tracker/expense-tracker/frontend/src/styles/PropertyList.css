/* Case 1:
css
Copy code
.image {
    max-width: 200px;
    max-height: 150px;
    object-fit: cover;
}
Effect on Image: This rule limits the image size to 200px width and 150px height as the maximum values.

If the image's natural dimensions (width and height) are smaller than these values, it will display at its original size without stretching.
If the image's natural size is larger, it will be scaled down to fit within the 200px width and 150px height limits. The aspect ratio will be preserved.
object-fit: cover; ensures that the image fills the container, cropping parts of it if the aspect ratio doesn't match.
When the image is smaller than the max dimensions: It will remain at its original size and not be resized.

When the image is larger than the max dimensions: The image will be resized to fit within the specified maximum dimensions, maintaining the aspect ratio and cropping if necessary.

Case 2:
css
Copy code
.image {
    width: 200px;
    height: 150px;
    object-fit: cover;
}
Effect on Image: Here, both width and height are explicitly set to 200px and 150px. The image will always be stretched or shrunk to these exact dimensions, regardless of its original size.

object-fit: cover; ensures the image still fills the container and might crop if the aspect ratio differs from the container's.
When the image is smaller than the specified size: It will be stretched to fit 200px width and 150px height.

When the image is larger than the specified size: It will be shrunk to fit the 200px width and 150px height, potentially cropping the image to preserve the container's aspect ratio.

Key Difference:
Max-Width/Max-Height (max-width, max-height) allow the image to stay smaller than the specified size if its natural size is smaller.
Fixed Width/Height (width, height) forces the image to always match the specified dimensions, regardless of the image's natural size. */
